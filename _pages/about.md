Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).
My research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and their downstream applications in healthcare. My primary focus is ~~.

Before joining Rice, I completed my B.S and M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Ewha Womans [sic] University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do). My master's thesis concerned quality-adaptive compression artifact removal by exploiting domain adaptation.

#### Site Credits
<sup><sub>This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating
when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, 
and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork 
[this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your
own site for free, with no ads!</sup></sub>
